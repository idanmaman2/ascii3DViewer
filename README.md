# ascii3DViewer - by IDHM 
( for much better 3d enigne checkout my another project : https://github.com/idanmaman2/ISE5782_6941_3797  that uses ray tracing ) 
# Depth image to 3d models (obj + torus knot ) 


# the Idea : 
> the idea of the project is based on the  game : "Pin art 3d "





> not like any other 3d engine that using triangles imagnation or ray tracing mine is way faster and much more simple and cool
> the whole idea is to send straight rays from the xy plane and map the z value to color and char . 
> and then print it 
> the program unabling rotating the shape in all axsises  and moving it in space  .

final result compare - took the obj models and compared the results  (on the same project idea diffrent way of implamntaion and technique ) : https://github.com/autopawn/3d-ascii-viewer
